# photosBackupSystem
A system for backing up Family Photos into a trusted system

After my sister had her iPhone swiped, I decieded too document how I backup my family photos.

With any backup system we have certen goals.
1. Create 3 copys of all photos.
  * One is our working copy.
  * One is our local backup
  * One is our off site backup
2. Make this happen whith no user action
3. There might not be a 3rd.

See the Wiki for the system.
